16486812	DoctorZen	.@psalmotoxin: Naked mole rats seem to have a reduction of c-fibers (mammalian nociceptors), but not related mole rats. #icn12	2012-08-10 15:07:14
16486812	DoctorZen	.@psalmotoxin Is reduction in c-fibers just because the naked mole rat is naked? Mutant hairless mouse suggests some, but not all #icn12	2012-08-10 15:08:47
16486812	DoctorZen	.@psalmotoxin Naked mole rats are almost completely insensitive to acid, perhaps due to underground lifestyle. #icn12	2012-08-10 15:10:44
16486812	DoctorZen	.@psalmotoxin Acid fails to activate naked mole rat nociceptors. But the neurons can respond to acid; ion channels still present. #icn12	2012-08-10 15:13:22
16486812	DoctorZen	.@psalmotoxin: A mutation causes an “acid block”: it does matter how much you depolarize the neuron, it won’t spike. #icn12	2012-08-10 15:23:58
